# 0x01. AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Overview
This project is part of the AirBnB clone, focusing on building the front-end of the application. The objective is to create static web pages using HTML and CSS, which will serve as the foundation for more complex, dynamic web applications.

## Background Context
### Web static, what?
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

### The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:
* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No JavaScript
* No data loaded from anything

During this project, one is meant to learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page and should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. It is highly encouraged to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is HTML
* How to create an HTML page
* What is a markup language
* What is the DOM
* What is an element / tag
* What is an attribute
* How does the browser load a webpage
* What is CSS
* How to add style to an element
* What is a class
* What is a selector
* How to compute CSS Specificity Value
* What are Box properties in CSS

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator
* All your CSS files should be in styles folder
* All your images should be in images folder
* You are not allowed to use !important and id (#... in the CSS file)
* You are not allowed to use tags img, embed and iframe
* You are not allowed to use Javascript
* Current screenshots have been done on Chrome 56 or more.
* No cross browsers
* You have to follow all requirements but some margin/padding are missing - you should try to fit as much as you can to screenshots

## Conclusion
This project is the foundation for developing the front end of the AirBnB clone project. By fully grasping HTML and CSS, the ability to create static web pages that form the basis for more complex web applications will be gained.
